<p>The Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project is a collaboration between Northrop Grumman and the schools Cal Poly Pomona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
The schools are tasked with the design and manufacturing of several unmanned vehicles such as a ground vehicle, aerial vehicle, and underwater vehicle.
Ultimately, the goal in mind is to have all unmanned vehicles collaborating together to perform tasks in a field demonstration.</p>
<p>My role in this project was to be the team lead for the unmanned underwater vehicle's projectile system. In short, our objective was
to provide the capability of shooting a projectile at an undetermined target.</p>
