<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hello, I recently graduated with Cum Laude in mechanical engineering from Cal Poly Pomona. My interests are in robotics, smart technology, and manufacturing. </p>

<p>I've done a couple internships overseas with DeltaLight Asia and with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I was also involved on campus with the Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project (NGCP) - Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, Human Powered Vehicle Club (HPVC), Pi Tau Sigma Honor Society, Tau beta Pi Honor Society and Epic Movement for which I have held several leadership positions. <a href="/cv">Download my CV for more information about my skills and experience.</a></p>

<p>I currently live in Alhambra, CA with my parents, and in my free time I like to play sports (basketball, soccer, badminton), watch asian dramas, and play computer games.</p>
