<p>Hello, I recently graduated with Cum Laude in mechanical engineering from Cal Poly Pomona. 
My interests are in robotics, smart technology, and manufacturing. </p>

<p>I've done a couple internships overseas with <a href="http://www.deltalight.com/en">DeltaLight Asia</a> and with the 
<a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>. </p>

<p>I was also involved on campus with the Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project (NGCP) - Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, 
Human Powered Vehicle Club (HPVC), Pi Tau Sigma Honor Society, Tau beta Pi Honor Society and 
Epic Movement for which I have held several leadership positions.
