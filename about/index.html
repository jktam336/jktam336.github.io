<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hello, I recently graduated with Cum Laude in mechanical engineering from Cal Poly Pomona. My interests are in robotics, smart technology, and manufacturing. </p>

<p>I've done internships overseas with DeltaLight Asia manufacturing light fixtures and with the Chinese University of Hong Kong researching precision micro-contact printing for roll-to-roll fabrication of flexible electronic devices.</p> 

<p>I was also involved on campus with the Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project (NGCP) - Unmanned Underwater Vehicle, Human Powered Vehicle Club (HPVC), Pi Tau Sigma Honor Society, Tau beta Pi Honor Society and Epic Movement for which I have held several leadership positions.</p>
