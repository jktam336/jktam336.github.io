I'm back on the hunt for jobs and in my spare time I've decided to update this website with a [Projects](/projects) page. 
This page will host a gallery directory to all my projects. Clicking on an image will take you to a dedicated project page for news and updates about that specific project.

I've also added a profile picture to my homepage. However, I'm having some trouble scaling and positioning my pictures.
I'll figure out how to fix it later, but as for right now I'm going pokemon hunting! Go Team Mystic!
